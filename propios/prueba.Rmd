## R Markdown

$$\int_{a}^{b}2\cdot 3^{x} + \sqrt[5]{\frac{1}{3}}$$
$$\sum_{i=0}^{n}$$

$$\left(\dfrac{a}{b}\right)$$
$$\begin{pmatrix} a & b & c\\ c & d & e\end{pmatrix}$$
`$$|x|=\left\{\begin{array}{rr}
-x & \text{si }x\le 0\\
x & \text{si }x\ge 0
\end{array}\right.$$`

```{r}

x = x + 1

```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
